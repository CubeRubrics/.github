## Branch names

Git branches *should* be named in the format `<section>-<type>/<description>`, i.e. `etl-feature/new-sources`

  - `<section>` is the approximate section of the program being worked on
  - `<type>` is the type of work being done, of the basic types:
    - `feature`: new feature or expansion
    - `hotfix`: quick turnaround fix
    - `bug`: extended bug fixing
    - `update`: updating and cleaning code
    - `dev`: standard development catchall
  
i.e. `etl-feature/new-sources`
